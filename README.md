## Construct parser combinator functions for parsing character vectors

This R package contains tools to construct parser combinator functions, also 
known as closures. The main application of parsers constructed with this 
package is the parsing of text files, read into a character vector. This 
package was inspired by the package 
["Ramble"](https://github.com/chappers/Ramble) by Chapman Siu and by the paper
["Higher-order functions for parsing"](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0956796800000411) 
by Graham Hutton (1992).
