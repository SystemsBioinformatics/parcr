## Construct parser combinator functions for parsing character

The package contains tools to construct parser combinator functions, also known as closures. The main application of parsers constructed with this package is the parsing of text files, read into a character vector. 
This package was inspired by the package "Ramble" by Chapman Siu and by the paper "Higher-order functions for parsing" by Graham Hutton (1992).
