#' Example nucleotide fasta file
#'
#' An example fasta-formatted file with a mixture of nucleotide and protein
#' sequences. It is used in the vignette to demonstrate parsing with the tools
#' from the package. It is not clear to me whether mixing of sequence types is
#' allowed in a fasta file, but we demonstrate in the vignette that is is easy
#' to parse them from a single file. The sequences used are truncated for the
#' sake of the example.
