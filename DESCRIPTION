Description: The package contains tools to construct parser combinator 
  functions, higher order functions that parse input. The main application of
  parsers constructed with this package is the parsing of text files, read 
  into a character vector. This package was inspired by the package "Ramble"
  by Chapman Siu and by the paper "Higher-order functions for parsing" by 
  Graham Hutton (1992).
