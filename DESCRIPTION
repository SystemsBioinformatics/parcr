Description: The package contains tools to construct parser combinator 
  functions, also known as closures. The main application of parsers constructed
  with this package is the parsing of text files, read into a character vector. 
  This package was inspired by the package "Ramble" by Chapman Siu and by the
  paper "Higher-order functions for parsing" by Graham Hutton (1992).
